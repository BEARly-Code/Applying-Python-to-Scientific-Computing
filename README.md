# Applying Python to Scientific Computing
***Learning Python by applying it to data science and scientific computing***
___

## Introduction
In this course we will learn the programming language [Python](https://python.org), by applying it to solving various problems in Data Science. We will also learn tools such as [IPython](https://ipython.org), [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org), and [SciPy](https://scipy.org)(i.e. NumPy, MatPlotLib, Pandas, etc.).

## Basics
Python is a Programming language that is run on computer systems by the use of the python interpreter, different version of Python exist but we shall learn Python by using IPython, an "interactive version of Python"

## Getting started
1. Install Python
    It comes pre-installed on most Linux systems, if you are using Windows or Mac OS, I suggest that you download and install [Ananconda](https://anaconda.com), on installing it you will also get IPython and Jupyter Notebooks, also most of the scientific computing tools available for Python, i.e. SciPy and NumPy.
2. Install The tool-set
    You can install the complete tool-set by yourself if all you have is a fresh install of the Linux OS, all you have to do is go download the [get-pip.py](https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py) Python Script(A file containing text commands to be run by the Interpreter), and install it my executing the following command in the folder within which the file has been downloaded.
    ```bash
    python get-pip.py
    ```
    Next you have to use [PyPi(pip)](https://pypi.org/project/pip) in installing Jupyter Notebooks which is an interface for IPython, this can be done by:
    ```bash
    pip install --upgrade pip
    python -m pip install --user numpy scipy matplotlib ipython jupyter pandas sympy nose
    ```
