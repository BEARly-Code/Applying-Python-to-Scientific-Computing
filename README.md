# Applying Python to Scientific Computing
***Learning Python by applying it to data science and scientific computing***
___

## Introduction
In this course we will learn the programming language [Python](https://python.org), by applying it to solving various problems in Data Science. We will also learn tools such as [IPython](https://ipython.org), [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org), and [SciPy](https://scipy.org)(i.e. NumPy, MatPlotLib, Pandas, etc.).

## Basics
Python is a Programming language that is run on computer systems by the use of the python interpreter, different version of Python exist but we shall learn Python by using IPython, an "interactive version of Python"
